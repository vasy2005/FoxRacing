		ScriptEng.Add("Look at your keyboard. There should be 3 rows of letters. The middle one is called the <Yellow>\"Home Row\"</> because typists are trained to keep their fingers on this row and always return to it after pressing any other key.");

		ScriptEng.Add("Understanding that, you should also know the basic rules of touch typing:");
		ScriptEng.Add("1.	The basic principle of touch typing is to use the finger that is closest to the home key each finger rests on, and to learn how to do this without looking at your keyboard.");
		ScriptEng.Add("2.	In touch typing, your two thumbs rest on the space bar. That's why it is so long.");
		ScriptEng.Add("3.	Have you ever wondered why there are 2 shift keys on your keyboard, one on the left and one on the right? This solves the problem of one hand having to hit both the shift key and another letter at the same time.");
		ScriptEng.Add("That\'s why, when typing a capital letter, you should use the opposite hand to press the shift key. Always press shift keys with your pinky finger.");
		ScriptEng.Add("That\'s all for now! Time to put what you\'ve learned into practice with the following exercises!");
		ScriptEng.Add("Remember: The right hand should be covering \"J K L ;\" with the right thumb on the space bar while the left-hand covers \"A S D F\" with the left thumb on the space bar. Don\'t rush, in this case accuracy is most important.");
