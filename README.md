Description
Touch typing is a typing method that gives the user the ability to type quickly, accurately, and without looking at the keyboard or searching for each key individually.
Until now, the only way to learn the touch typing method was through various educational websites, consisting of many typing exercises. These can be very boring and difficult to get through.
Fox Racing aims to make the process of increasing your typing speed using this method more enjoyable and accessible to the general public.
In Fox Racing, the user plays the role of a fox racing against six other animals to become the swiftest fox in the animal kingdom.

It is recommended to use a system with a dedicated and highly performant graphics card.
For older systems or those with weaker graphics cards, it is recommended to adjust the quality in the Settings menu (Low - Medium).
Obviously, depending on the system, the game will sacrifice graphic details for performance.
