Touchtyping is a typing method that gives the user the ability to type quickly, accurately, and without looking at the keyboard or searching for each key individually.

Until now, the only way to learn touchtyping was through various educational sites, consisting of many typing exercises. These can be very tedious and difficult to navigate.

Fox Racing aims to make the process of increasing typing speed using this method more enjoyable and accessible to the general public.

In Fox Racing, you play the role of a fox who competes with other animals to become the fastest fox in the animal kingdom. Have fun!
